# ARIA - AI-based Research and Interpretation Assistant ðŸš€

ARIA (AI-based Research and Interpretation Assistant) is a powerful AI-powered tool designed to assist users in extracting, interpreting, and interacting with information from a wide variety of file formats. Built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face**, ARIA can process documents, images, audio, and more, making it an ideal assistant for researchers, students, and professionals.

## Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: Extract text from **PDFs**, **Word documents**, **Excel sheets**, **PowerPoint presentations**, **images**, **audio files**, and more.
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Interact with the assistant using natural language to ask questions and get insights from uploaded files.
- **Online and Offline Modes**: 
  - **Online Mode**: Uses the **Mistral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1** model via the Together API for advanced AI capabilities.
  - **Offline Mode**: Uses the **Sol model** (ChatOllama) for local, offline interactions.
- **File Processing**: Automatically processes uploaded files and creates a searchable knowledge base using **FAISS** vector embeddings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, ARIA provides an intuitive and interactive web interface.

## Supported File Formats

ARIA supports the following file formats for text extraction:
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, LaTeX
- **Spreadsheets**: XLS, XLSX, CSV
- **Presentations**: PPTX
- **Code Files**: Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, Swift, R, Rust, SQL

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Users upload one or more files through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Text Extraction**: ARIA extracts text from the uploaded files using specialized libraries like PyPDF2, pytesseract, and BeautifulSoup.
3. **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
4. **Vector Embeddings**: Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using **Hugging Face's Sentence Transformers**.
5. **Conversational AI**: Users can ask questions about the uploaded files, and ARIA uses a **Conversational Retrieval Chain** to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
6. **Chat History**: ARIA maintains a conversation history, allowing users to interact naturally.
